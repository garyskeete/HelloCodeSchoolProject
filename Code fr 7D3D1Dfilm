Coding
What if
There were multiple coding languages all coinciding to preform actions on one application?
Are they to be written separately under appropriate headings or titles R SQL Ruby
Can the be written in entirety line after line and recognized?

My intentions with the combination of languages git R Ruby SQL Python HTML Java JavaScript Powershell is to construct from scratch a 3D Cartesian Graph for translation into 1D and projection into 7D this would be the basis for the Camera Holographic's and Teleportation project as it would constitute the working part of Biological Film -see ‪http://Github.com/garyskeete‬ RSVP if this coaligns with codeschool projects currently please send examples.
